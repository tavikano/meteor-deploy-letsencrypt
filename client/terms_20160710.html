    <p class="c2"><span class="c3 fw600">Payments, Payouts, Fees.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Users can make payments through our platform to any Website Owner in our network. Payments can be made by credit card or debit card and are processed by Stripe. Payments are subject to Stripe transacion fees and a Drizzle service fee. Users pay the Drizzle service fee. Website Owners pay the Stripe transaction fee. See Stripe&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stripe.com/us/terms&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1458350083372000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtgLC3psKy9iVxcurdeDS5_TDOIg">Terms of Service</a></span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stripe.com/us/privacy&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1458350083373000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2lzAAAD9QxrSD8Lxvb9KAy6wD_g">Privacy Policy</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>to understand the conditions of payments through their system. By providing a credit or debit card on your Drizzle account, you expressly agree that Drizzle is authorized to charge your card for any pay-per-content or subscription purchases, including our transaction and platform fees, that you make using Drizzle.</span></p><p class="c2"><span> If you want to use a different credit or debit card than the one you signed up to use during registration, or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your card information by logging into your Drizzle account and clicking update card information section. When you provide a card to buy a subscription, including in connection with a free trial offer, our system will attempt to verify the information you entered. We do this by processing an authorization hold, which is a standard practice. We do not charge you in connection with this authorization hold. If your card expires and you do not edit your card information or cancel your account, you authorize us to continue billing, and you will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. </span></p><p class="c2"><span> When a User visits a website in our network and pays for content using our platform, the payment is transferred to the Website Owner&rsquo;s account. For every payment, the User is charged the price of the content set by the Website Owner plus a Drizzle service fee of 4% of the payment.
</span></p><p class="c2"><span>For single payments of less than $1, the User is charged when the total of the payments reaches $1 and or on the 25th of the month. The User is charged the sum of the accrued single payments since the last payment and a Drizzle service fee of 4% of the total charge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>For buying a subscription or daily pass, the User is charged immediately. The User is charged the subscription price and a Drizzle service fee of 4% of the charge. Subscription charges recur each week, month, or year, depending on the subscription option. For weekly subscriptions, the charge will recur on the same day of the week (e.g. Monday) that the subscription was initially started. For monthly subscriptions, the charge will recur on the same day of the month (e.g. the 20th day of the month) that the subscription was initially started. For example, if a user starts a $10 subscription on a website, the charge is made immediately and is $10.50 total ($10 subscription price + $0.30 transaction fee + $0.20 Drizzle service fee). The same charge of $10.50 will recur in one month, unless the subscriber cancels his or her subscription before that date. Payments are not refundable.</span></p><p class="c2"><span> Some websites in our network offer a free trial for a particular subscription for certain qualifying users. If you receive a free trial on a website through Drizzle, the specific terms of your free trial will be stated during your sign up or log in.</span></p><p class="c2"><span> Once your free trial period ends, we will begin billing your registered credit or debit card for your recurring subscription fees (plus our transaction and platform fees), unless you cancel prior to the end of your free trial. For that reason, unless otherwise indicated in the free trial description, you may be asked to set up a valid credit or debit card when redeeming a free trial offer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span> You will not necessarily receive a notice from Drizzle or the website providing the free trial that your free trial has ended and that payment for your subscription is due. If you wish to avoid charges, you must cancel your subscription prior to the last day of your free trial period. You may cancel your subscription at any time. We will continue to bill your registered credit or debit card for your subscription on a recurring basis corresponding to the term of your subscription until you cancel or your account or the website offering the subscription is otherwise suspended or discontinued pursuant to these Terms.</span></p><p class="c2"><span> Website Owners receive payments in their Drizzle account when Users select to pay for the Website Owner's content with our platform. Website Owners pay the transaction fee of 2% + 0.30, which is set by our payment processor Stripe, on each payment they receive from Users. Drizzle makes payouts to Website Owners on the 30th of each month (or the last day of the month) through Paypal or Dwolla. Website Owners must register with </span><span class="c8"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.paypal.com/home&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1458350083375000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHC4GDt3VK4tT8BG79cPDNwsE4FEA">PayPal</a></span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c8"><a class="c15" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dwolla.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1458350083375000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGltGLTZkvDZNYpvZhsoicN0Z7NWw">Dwolla</a></span><span>&nbsp;and share their email address with either service to receive payouts. </span><span>A Website Owner must have a balance of at least $25 in completed payments to receive a payout.
